This is an automated build of SheepShaver and BasiliskII as AppImages for 32-bit and 64-bit x86 Linux created periodically and [on-demand](https://github.com/Korkman/macemu-appimage-builder/issues/10). If the continuous release does not work for you, try a snapshot build instead.

To build your own and for more information on how to use the contained files, see [README.md](https://github.com/Korkman/macemu-appimage-builder/blob/main/README.md)
